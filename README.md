What does Bionic Reading.

Bionic Reading revises texts so that the most concise parts of words are highlighted. This guides the eye over the text and the brain remembers previously learned words more quickly.

I am not affiliated with Bionic Reading GmbH and all credit for the concept of Bionic Reading goes to Bionic Reading GmbH.
